Overview:
==========
The Web Coverage Tiling Service (WCTS) SWG will develop an OGC Standard that supports the requirements for disseminating geospatial data in tiles to lightweight devices. Furthermore, this Standard will define in detail how existing Standards that are well used in the IT domain are to be used to enable data tiling functionality in OGC services.
   
About
-----

The repo tracks the latest version of the WCTS specification as it evolves. Pull requests for fixes are
appreciated, and new functionality will still be considered even though version 1.0 has been adopted. The spec
is done in [asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) a format supported by GitHub, similar to markdown
but with some features that make it better for specifications, like automatic section numbering.

Contributing
